Welcome to GPViz's documentation!
=================================

GPViz is a Gaussian process visualisation library specifically designed for seamless plotting integration with `GPJax <https://github.com/thomaspinder/GPJax>`_.

You can view the source code for GPViz `here on Github <https://github.com/thomaspinder/GPViz>`_

Installation
-----------------------------------------------------

GPViz can be installed by simply running the following command

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install gpviz

It is recommended that this is done from within a virtual environment as the Jax/GPJax dependencies are quite strict.
